                         <p class="personality">Baba Awo as he is fondly called is an exceptional role model to many Nigerians and could be described as another legendary patron-saint of the Nigeria race.
                          He is a pathfinder that founded a political party,the Action Group,to negotiate alliances with other leaders in persuading the British to grant Independence to Nigeria through peaceful and carefully planned constitutional and constructive process.

                          <p>Here's a quote from this great man</p>
                          <blockquote class="his words">After rain comes sunshine; After darkness comes the glorious dawn. There is no sorrow without its alloy of joy; there is no joy without its admixture of sorrow. Behind the ugly terrible mask of misfortune lies the beautiful soothing countenance of prosperity. So, tear the mask!

                            -- Obafemi Awolowo
